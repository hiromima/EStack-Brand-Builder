# GitHub Actions Test

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Purpose**: Verify GitHub Actions workflows after enabling public repository

## Test Objectives

1. ✅ Verify PR creation triggers workflows
2. ✅ Test Gemini AI code review integration
3. ✅ Validate quality gate execution
4. ✅ Confirm cost monitoring is active
5. ✅ Ensure all workflows run without billing errors

## Repository Status

- **Visibility**: PUBLIC
- **GitHub Actions**: Enabled (unlimited free)
- **Workflows Active**: 6 workflows
  - agent-onboarding.yml
  - economic-circuit-breaker.yml
  - gemini-pr-review.yml
  - incident-response.yml
  - quality-check.yml
  - quality-gate.yml

## Expected Results

### Gemini PR Review Workflow
- Should trigger on PR creation
- Should analyze code changes
- Should post review comments
- Should use GEMINI_API_KEY from secrets

### Quality Gate Workflow
- Should run on PR
- Should validate code quality
- Should check BaseAgent compliance
- Should report pass/fail status

### Economic Circuit Breaker
- Should monitor API costs
- Should alert if thresholds exceeded
- Should not block (currently in monitor mode)

## Test Code Sample

```javascript
// Simple test function to trigger code review
export function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export function calculateProduct(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```

## Notes

This is a minimal test PR to verify that:
- GitHub Actions workflows execute successfully
- No billing errors occur (public repo = free)
- Gemini API integration is working
- All automated checks pass

## Success Criteria

- [ ] PR created successfully
- [ ] At least one workflow starts
- [ ] No billing/payment errors
- [ ] Workflows complete (pass or fail is OK, just need execution)
- [ ] Gemini API called successfully (if configured)
